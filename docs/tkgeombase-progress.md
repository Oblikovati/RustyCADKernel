# TKGeomBase port status

**In progress; toolkit acceptance is not complete.** `crates/tkgeombase`
(`rustycad-tkgeombase`) is the port of the ModelingData toolkit TKGeomBase. It
depends on the TKernel, TKMath, TKG2d and TKG3d ports, as the native toolkit
does. Packages are added one module at a time; none is ported yet.

The Geom and Geom2d objects that TKGeomBase builds follow the class mapping of
[geom-design.md](geom-design.md).

| Source | Rust target | Declarations |

## Verification

`python3 tools/verify_toolkit.py TKGeomBase --jobs 8 --source OCCT --native-build BUILD`
compiles the unchanged upstream suites against the native closure, runs them and
the Rust targets, checks exact runtime names, then runs
`tools/verify_tkgeombase_numeric.py`. Evidence is in `target/oracle-tkgeombase/`.

## Numeric comparison policy

`tools/verify_tkgeombase_numeric.py` uses the shared driver `tools/toolkit_numeric.py`
(also used by TKG2d and TKG3d). It builds `tools/oracle/tkgeombase_probe.cxx` (a
table of operations over `tkgeombase_probe_*.cxx`, linked with libTKGeomBase and
the toolkits below it) and its twin `crates/tkgeombase/examples/numeric_probe.rs`,
runs both on `tools/tkgeombase_corpus.py` (one `tkgeombase_corpus_*.py` module per
package) and requires identical bits for finite values, infinities and signed
zeros, NaN by classification and identical exception types.

## Preserved native behaviour
