# TKGeomAlgo design notes

This note fixes how the TKGeomAlgo port (`crates/tkgeomalgo`, see
[tkgeomalgo-progress.md](tkgeomalgo-progress.md)) maps C++ constructs that the earlier
design notes ([geom-design.md](geom-design.md), [topology-design.md](topology-design.md))
do not cover. Each package adds its section before it codes the construct.

## 1. Generic templates (`.gxx` and `.pxx`)

OCCT writes much of TKGeomAlgo as generic source files: a `.gxx` (or a `.pxx`/`.lxx`)
body is included by one or more `_0.cxx` files after macros name the concrete types
(`IntCurve_IntConicConic`, `IntCurveSurface_TheInterferenceOfHInter`,
`TopClass_FaceClassifier`...). The rule for the whole toolkit:

- The template body is ported **once**, in the module of the package that owns the
  `.gxx`, as a Rust generic (a struct or function generic over a trait).
- The trait holds exactly the operations the template calls on its type parameters
  (the `ThePolygon`, `ThePolyhedron`, `TheTool` macros), under the native names; it is
  owned by the package of the template.
- Each native instantiation is a type alias (or a thin wrapper when the instance adds
  members), declared in the package that instantiates it natively, with the concrete
  types implementing the trait there.
- Floating-point operation order and control flow follow the template body; a
  monomorphized Rust generic executes the same operations as each C++ instance.

The sections below record each template as it is ported.

## 2. Intf_InterferencePolygonPolyhedron.gxx

The template computes the interference between a 3d polygon (or straight lines) and a
triangulated polyhedron. Its `.gxx` names four macro types: `Polygon3d` and
`Polyhedron` (the data) and `ToolPolygon3d` and `ToolPolyh` (classes of static members
over the data). OCCT instantiates it twice, as
`IntCurveSurface_TheInterferenceOfHInter` (TKGeomAlgo) and
`HLRBRep_TheInterferenceOfInterCSurf` (TKHLR).

- The body is `intf::InterferencePolygonPolyhedron<PT, HT>` in
  `crates/tkgeomalgo/src/intf/interference_polygon_polyhedron`, generic over two
  traits of static functions that mirror the tool classes: `intf::Polygon3dTool`
  (`Bounding`, `DeflectionOverEstimation`, `Closed`, `NbSegments`, `BeginOfSeg`,
  `EndOfSeg`) and `intf::PolyhedronTool` (`Bounding`, `ComponentsBounding`,
  `DeflectionOverEstimation`, `Triangle`, `Point`, `TriConnex`, `IsOnBound`,
  `GetBorderDeflection`). Each trait has an associated type for its data
  (`Polygon`, `Polyhedron`), so the data types stay free of the traits, as the
  native tools are separate classes.
- An instantiating package declares its tool classes as unit structs that implement
  the traits (for example `IntCurveSurface_ThePolygonToolOfHInter`) and the
  interference as a type alias:
  `type TheInterferenceOfHInter = InterferencePolygonPolyhedron<ThePolygonToolOfHInter, ThePolyhedronToolOfHInter>;`.
  Its api rows map the members of the instance header to the generic's methods.
- Tool members that index arrays can raise natively (Standard_OutOfRange), so the
  trait members that take an index return `Result`, and so do the constructors and
  `Perform` overloads of the generic.
- `Intf_Interference` is the protected base of every interference; the generic and
  `InterferencePolygon2d` hold one and expose it through `Deref`.
- The two private `Intersect` overloads have the same body after the plane equation;
  the five-argument one computes the plane equation and the distances and calls the
  nine-argument one, so the body exists once.
