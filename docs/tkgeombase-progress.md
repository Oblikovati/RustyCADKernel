# TKGeomBase port status

**In progress; toolkit acceptance is not complete.** `crates/tkgeombase`
(`rustycad-tkgeombase`) is the port of the ModelingData toolkit TKGeomBase. It
depends on the TKernel, TKMath, TKG2d and TKG3d ports, as the native toolkit
does. Packages are added one module at a time. The `gce` package is ported in full,
and `tools/audit_api_rows.py` reports 0 missing and 0 stale api rows for it.

The Geom and Geom2d objects that TKGeomBase builds follow the class mapping of
[geom-design.md](geom-design.md).

The toolkit test inventory maps these complete suites, with matching native and Rust
passes (42 declarations):

| Source | Rust target | Declarations |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| gce_MakeCirc2d_Test.cxx | gce_make_circ2d | 3 |
| gce_MakeCone_Test.cxx | gce_make_cone | 9 |
| gce_MakeCylinder_Test.cxx | gce_make_cylinder | 3 |
| gce_MakeElips_Test.cxx | gce_make_elips | 3 |
| gce_MakeHypr_Test.cxx | gce_make_hypr | 24 |

`gce_behavior.rs` covers the status enumeration, the StdFail_NotDone results, the
conversion operators and the unassigned-status paths.

## Class mapping

Each `gce_Make*` class is a struct with one named constructor per native overload
(`MakeCirc::through_points`, `MakeCone::from_points_radii`...). A constructor returns
`Result` when a gp constructor it calls can raise, so a native exception stays a
`Failure` instead of a status. `gce_Root` is the `Root` trait (`status`, `is_done`,
`is_error`); `Value()` and `Operator()` return `Result` (StdFail_NotDone, with the
status in the message, when the construction failed), and the conversion operator
`operator gp_Circ()` is `TryFrom<&MakeCirc> for Circle3`. The transformation makers
(`MakeMirror`, `MakeRotation`, `MakeScale`, `MakeTranslation` and their 2D twins) are
not gce_Root algorithms: `value()` returns the transformation and the conversion is
`From`.

`gce_MakeCirc` and `gce_MakeCirc2d` call `Extrema_ExtElC` on two lines and
`IntAna2d_AnaIntersection` on two 2D lines, which are TKGeomBase packages not ported
yet. `src/line_extrema.rs` ports exactly those line cases in the native operation
order; the Extrema and IntAna2d ports will replace it.

## Verification

`python3 tools/verify_toolkit.py TKGeomBase --jobs 8 --source OCCT --native-build BUILD`
compiles the unchanged upstream suites against the native closure, runs them and
the Rust targets, checks exact runtime names, then runs
`tools/verify_tkgeombase_numeric.py`. Evidence is in `target/oracle-tkgeombase/`.

## Numeric comparison policy

`tools/verify_tkgeombase_numeric.py` uses the shared driver `tools/toolkit_numeric.py`
(also used by TKG2d and TKG3d). It builds `tools/oracle/tkgeombase_probe.cxx` (a
table of operations over `tkgeombase_probe_*.cxx`, linked with libTKGeomBase and
the toolkits below it) and its twin `crates/tkgeombase/examples/numeric_probe.rs`,
runs both on `tools/tkgeombase_corpus.py` (one `tkgeombase_corpus_*.py` module per
package) and requires identical bits for finite values, infinities and signed
zeros, NaN by classification and identical exception types.

The gce requests build every constructor overload of every class with random valid
inputs and with the degenerate inputs that reach each reachable gce_ErrorType and each
raising gp constructor: coincident points (exact, within gp::Resolution() and
denormal), collinear points, null and negative radii, null, right and negative
angles, frames along every coordinate axis (each branch of the X-direction choices),
and magnitudes near 1e-160 and 1e150 where squares underflow or overflow. Each
request prints the status, `IsDone`, `IsError`, `Value()` and `Operator()` (or the
raised exception). The native algorithm is created with `new`, which zeroes it, so
the paths that never assign the status compare as the port reads them.

## Preserved native behaviour

gce:

- gce_Root has no constructor, and three paths never assign the status:
  `gce_MakeCirc(P1, P2, P3)` with three points within gp::Resolution() or a computed
  center on P1 (both return a null circle), and `gce_MakeCirc2d(P1, P2, P3)` when the
  bisectors are parallel (collinear points; the circle keeps its default value). A
  stack algorithm reads an indeterminate status there; the port reads gce_Done, the
  value of a heap algorithm (the OCCT allocator zeroes memory).
- gce_IntersectionError is unreachable in `gce_MakeCirc` and `gce_MakeCirc2d`: the line
  extremum and the line intersection are always done. Identical bisectors in 2D would
  raise Standard_OutOfRange from `IntAna2d_AnaIntersection::Point(1)`.
- `gce_MakeCirc(Center, Plane, Radius)` reads `Value()` of the center-normal
  construction, so a negative radius raises StdFail_NotDone.
- `gce_MakeCirc2d(Circ, Dist)` takes `|Radius + Dist|` and never fails, while the 3D
  and cylinder versions report gce_NegativeRadius.
- `gce_MakeElips(A2, ...)` checks gce_InvertRadius before gce_NegativeRadius, the 2D
  version the other way round; `gce_MakeHypr` accepts a major radius smaller than the
  minor one.
- `gce_MakeElips2d(S1, S2, Center)` normalizes both directions before any check, so
  S1 or S2 at the center raises Standard_ConstructionError; it reports gce_InvertAxis
  before gce_NullAxis.
- `gce_MakeCone(P1, P2, P3, P4)` normalizes P3 - P1 and P4 - P1 without a check (P3 or
  P4 at P1 raises Standard_ConstructionError); it reports gce_NullAngle when P3 and P4
  project to the same axis point and gce_NullRadius for a null or right semi-angle,
  while `gce_MakeCone(P1, P2, R1, R2)` reports gce_NullAngle for the latter; its
  gce_NegativeRadius test on two distances is unreachable.
- `gce_MakeDir(X, Y, Z)`, `gce_MakeLin2d(A, B, C)` and `gce_MakePln(A, B, C, D)`
  compare the square length with gp::Resolution().
- `gce_MakeScale` raises Standard_ConstructionError for a null factor (gp_Trsf), while
  `gce_MakeScale2d` accepts it (gp_Trsf2d).
